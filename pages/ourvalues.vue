		<h2>Our Values</h2>
		<p>
			We believe in Simple Truth Truth. In everyday language, it’s defined as
			being in one accord with fact or reality. Reality can change. Facts are
			temporal. For Believers, Truth is much more than that. Truth does not
			change. Truth just is - regardless of what the world deems as fact or
			reality today. Why? Because we believe that Truth is only found in the
			Word of God - it does not change and it just is. Truth ALWAYS has the
			final say and will ALWAYS lead to a life of peace, prosperity, security,
			stability, health and healing for those who believe. It’s just that
			simple.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are Revealing Truth Ministries - Where lives are changed, communities
			are impacted and Christ is put on display through the Simple Truth of
			God’s Word.
