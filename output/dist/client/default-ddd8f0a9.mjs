Welcome to the INSTITUTE of FORGIVENESS!  During the course of this series, we will explore and come to learn:
- The NATURE of forgiveness
- What is RELEASED when we forgive
- The role of RESTORATION in forgiveness

Everyone has a thought about forgiveness - what it is; what it isn\u2019t; who it\u2019s for; who benefits from it; how to do it; if it\u2019s healthy; if it\u2019s not.  A discussion about forgiveness can get complex fast because of how we each see it, which is often not like Jesus sees it.  We look at people and their track record instead of at Jesus and His!  But, if we are to be built to last, we must know that we are built to FORGIVE like Jesus.`,image:"/images/PLnoMLl1eIRc5iPhyX6NqVPFXPCpz7WyUP.jpg",title:"Only If",slug:"only-if"},{id:"PLnoMLl1eIRc4xLt5yalXQVGiybznE9xn-",description:`It is impossible to be built to last if you've been programmed to quit." - Pastor Bryan Powe
This series is about commitment - our commitment to:
- People
- Purpose

Many people come to God looking for a particular solution to a particular problem.  They want a better marriage or their children to be saved or healing.  They want a better relationship with people or they want to know and understand their purpose.  What happens when you get your answer?  What happens when you don't?  Oftentimes, people quit!  They quit on God because they don't get their solution - still sick or get divorced - or they quit because they DID - I'm good now; I got what I came for.

What makes a person not quit on God when they haven't gotten their answer yet?  What makes them stick with Him when it takes longer than they thought?  What makes her stay with God after EVERYTHING she asked for is received and more?`,image:"/images/PLnoMLl1eIRc4xLt5yalXQVGiybznE9xn-.jpg",title:"Till Death do us part",slug:"till-death-do-us-part"},{id:"PLnoMLl1eIRc7DGl_foqDLYb3Twly4ITFf",description:`How are you going to be built to last if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been built to do." - Pastor Bryan Powe

This series is about responding to the call of Jesus on our lives.  But, before we can respond, we have to know HOW He calls.  We have to understand WHAT we have been built to do.

Once we identify that we have been called, we will build our confidence to answer by understanding:

- We have been EQUIPPED.
- We have been ASSIGNED.
- We have been RELEASED`,image:"/images/PLnoMLl1eIRc7DGl_foqDLYb3Twly4ITFf.jpg",title:"Roll Call",slug:"roll-call"},{id:"PLnoMLl1eIRc7b1lV_s-10W3Enl1q1GuoY",description:`Truth is\u2026 Just because we don't see God moving doesn\u2019t mean He isn\u2019t active. - Pastor Bryan Powe

Although our emotions may be up and down, God never wavers about how He sees things. He is constant. He is a firm foundation. He has built us to last and endure all things in relentless obedience to Him.

So why do we worry?  How do we know what to do when we don't know what to do?  How can we be okay when we're not okay?  

Don't Worry Stay Ready will reveal those answers and more!`,image:"/images/PLnoMLl1eIRc7b1lV_s-10W3Enl1q1GuoY.jpg",title:"Don'	 Worry Stay Ready! Description",slug:"dont-worry-stay-ready"},{id:"PLnoMLl1eIRc7M2q48ZyGlwJQ4fn1FsRzr",description:`Our theme for 2021 is Built to Last.

These messages from our Senior Pastor, Overseeing Pastor and Campus Pastors will help us connect with, confirm what God has been sharing with us personally and give clarity to some of the most common questions we all face:

- What are we building?
- Who are we building for?
- Who are we building with?
- Where are we building?
- What does building something to last feel like and look like?

These messages are full of practical, personal and powerful words to change the trajectory of your family and those you come in contact with.`,image:"/images/PLnoMLl1eIRc7M2q48ZyGlwJQ4fn1FsRzr.jpg",title:"Built to last",slug:"built-to-last"},{id:"PLnoMLl1eIRc4493JoX452LtupLdHRBH_P",description:"What would Jesus do.  No, really, what would Jesus do?  It\u2019s not just a trendy question to wear around your wrist or put on the back of your car.  It\u2019s a very real question that we need a very real answer for.  How will we perceive that God is doing a new thing?   How will we move from \u2018I think it was God\u2019 to \u2018I know it was God\u2019?  How can we get involved in what God is doing if we don\u2019t know what He would do - what\u2019s in His nature to do?  If we are to be built to last, we must know what we are built to do - which is to be like Christ.  And to be like Him, we must think like Him and see things like Him.

SOON ENOUGH.\u201D - Pastor Bryan Powe

Sitting on the bench.  Knowing you are full of promise.  Knowing what you are built for. Knowing you heard from God.  But waiting.  Waiting to be used in a way that matches what you saw. Just waiting.  Ready to get to work.  Anxious to get to work.  Willing to get to work.  But waiting.  

What do you do while you wait?  What if your willingness to wait must be transformed into a willingness to be...ANYTHING.  A willingness to do\u2026 ANYTHING.`,image:"/images/PLnoMLl1eIRc6mzQQn5PbsvobR6-Xl02oE.jpg",title:"Soon Enough",slug:"soon-enough"},{id:"PLnoMLl1eIRc6mMrN3Tq5BbVREowKsiP2e",description:`Is there one who is willing to respond to the call to Contend for the Faith?
